#Welcome to roguelike!
I want create a educational or knowledge base
website,which include some knowledge of a
computer games.
Of course! No problem at all. Thank you for the clarification.

It's an excellent idea to create an educational website or knowledge base focused on computer games. Based on your initial message, here is what I understand about the project so far:

### 1. The Core Subject: Roguelike Games
You've specified "roguelike," which is a specific genre of computer games with distinct characteristics. This gives the project a clear and fascinating focus. The key features of roguelikes are:
*   **Procedural Generation:** Levels, items, and enemies are randomly generated for each playthrough, ensuring unique experiences.
*   **Permadeath:** When your character dies, you lose most progress and must start over from the beginning. This emphasizes careful strategy and learning from mistakes.
*   **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Players can take their time to make decisions, leading to deep tactical play.
*   **High Difficulty & Resource Management:** These games are often challenging and require players to master game mechanics to succeed.

These elements make roguelikes a perfect subject for an educational site, as player progression is directly tied to knowledge acquisition.

### 2. The Website's Purpose: Educational Knowledge Base
You want this to be more than just a collection of tips and tricks. You're aiming for a structured, in-depth resource. This could include:
*   **Explaining Core Mechanics:** Deep dives into how procedural generation works, combat formulas, status effects, and game balance.
*   **Game Design Philosophy:** Analyzing why these games are designed this way and the psychological impact of concepts like permadeath.
*   **Historical Context & Evolution:** Tracing the genre from its origins (like the game "Rogue") to classic titles (e.g., "NetHack") and modern hybrids often called "Roguelites" (e.g., "Hades," "Slay the Spire," "The Binding of Isaac").
*   **Culture and Community:** Documenting the terminology, player stories, and community traditions that have developed around these games.

### 3. A Preliminary Website Structure
To organize this knowledge effectively, the site could have sections like:
*   **Homepage:** Introduction, featured articles, latest updates.
*   **The Knowledge Base (Core Section):**
    *   **Game Library:** A curated list of games, categorized (e.g., Classic Roguelikes, Modern Roguelites).
    *   **Mechanic Deep Dives:** Articles on specific mechanics like "The Psychology of Permadeath," "How Randomness Creates Stories," etc.
    *   **Design Patterns:** Explaining common design elements in the genre.
    *   **Glossary:** Defining terms like "Meta-Progression," "Proc Gen," "Roguelite vs. Roguelike."
*   **For Developers:** Resources for those interested in creating their own roguelikes (design theories, tool recommendations, tutorials).
*   **Community Hub:** A section for user comments, forums, or submitted guides.

To help you move forward and for me to provide more specific, actionable advice, it would be very helpful to know more about your vision. Here are some key questions:

1.  **Target Audience:** Who is this website primarily for?
    *   **Casual Gamers:** Looking for game recommendations and beginner guides?
    *   **Enthusiasts & Students:** Interested in deep analysis of game design and mechanics?
    *   **Aspiring Developers:** Wanting to learn how to build their own roguelike games?

2.  **Scope of Games:** Will you focus strictly on **traditional, classic roguelikes** (like "Rogue," "NetHack") or also include the broader and more popular **modern roguelite** games (like "Hades," "Dead Cells," "Returnal")?

3.  **Desired Features:** What kind of functionality do you imagine?
    *   A static, wiki-like article database?
    *   Interactive elements, like a **game mechanic simulator**, an **item database with filters**, or a **procedural generation visualizer**?
    *   User accounts for contributions, comments, and ratings?

4.  **Content Creation:** Do you plan to write all the content yourself, or do you envision a community-driven platform (like a wiki) where multiple users can contribute and edit?

The more details you can provide, the better I can assist you in building a concrete plan and roadmap for this project. Let's build this together
